# Licence-Plate-Number-Recognition-System
Created a Licence Plate Number Recognition System using python, pytesseract library, OpenCV library.
Also made a GUI for easy working.
When a picture of a car containing the number plate is uploaded the number plate is detected and characters on the plate area are extracted by image processing algorithm. 
All the characters are then recognized using CNN and the numbers recognized are displayed on the GUI along with the cropped image of number plate detected stored in the folder.
